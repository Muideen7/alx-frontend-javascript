## Description

The `0x01-ES6_promise` directory focuses on learning and implementing ES6 promises in JavaScript. Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations and provide a more elegant and structured approach to dealing with asynchronous code.

The files in this directory cover topics such as creating promises, chaining promises, handling errors, and utilizing promise methods like `Promise.all()` and `Promise.race()`.

## Learning Objectives

By working with the files in this directory, you will be able to:

- Understand the concept of promises in JavaScript
- Create promises using the `Promise` constructor
- Handle asynchronous operations using promises
- Chain promises for sequential execution
- Handle errors and exceptions in promise chains
- Utilize promise methods like `Promise.all()` and `Promise.race()`

## Files

The following files are included in this directory:

- `0-promise.js`: Example code demonstrating the creation and usage of promises.
- `1-promise.js`: Example code showcasing promise chaining and handling errors.
- `2-then.js`: Example code demonstrating the usage of the `then()` method for promises.
- `3-all.js`: Example code illustrating the usage of the `Promise.all()` method.
- `4-user-promise.js`: Example code implementing a custom promise for handling API requests.

## Setup

To run and test the JavaScript files in this directory, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Clone the `alx-frontend` repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the `0x01-ES6_promise` directory inside the `alx-frontend` repository.
4. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
5. Run the desired JavaScript file using Node.js, for example: `node 0-promise.js`.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the JavaScript files in this directory to understand the concepts of ES6 promises. You can modify the code or create your own examples to experiment with promises and gain a deeper understanding of their functionality.

To run the JavaScript files and see the output, follow the setup instructions mentioned above.
