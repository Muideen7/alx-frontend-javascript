## Introduction

ES6 introduced a new syntax for creating and working with classes in JavaScript. Classes provide a way to define blueprints for creating objects with shared properties and methods. They follow the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm and provide a more structured approach to organizing and reusing code.

This repository aims to familiarize you with the concepts of classes and their various features, such as constructors, methods, static methods, inheritance, and more. It includes examples that illustrate the syntax and usage of ES6 classes and provides exercises to practice and reinforce the learned concepts.

## Getting Started

To get started with the examples and exercises in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
git clone <repository-url>

2. Navigate to the `0x02-ES6_classes` directory
cd 0x02-ES6_classes

3. Explore the examples and exercises available in the repository.

## Examples

The examples in this repository cover a wide range of class-related topics and scenarios. Some of the topics covered include:

- Creating classes with constructors
- Defining instance methods and static methods
- Implementing inheritance and extending classes
- Overriding inherited methods
- Accessing superclass methods using `super`
- Utilizing getters and setters
- Working with class modules

Feel free to explore the examples and experiment with the code to gain a better understanding of how classes work in JavaScript.

## Exercises

The exercises provided in this repository are designed to reinforce the concepts learned in the examples. Each exercise comes with a set of instructions and a starter code. You are encouraged to modify and complete the code to achieve the desired outcome.

To work on the exercises:

1. Open the exercise file in a code editor.
2. Read the instructions and understand the requirements.
3. Modify the code as needed to solve the exercise.
4. Test your code to ensure it produces the expected results.
5. Repeat the process for each exercise.

Feel free to consult the provided solutions for reference if you get stuck or want to compare your implementation.
